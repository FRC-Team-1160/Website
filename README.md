#Team1160 v4.0 "BERYLLIUM"

##Theme by Titanium Robotics and Nathan Wong

This is the fourth version of the Titanium Robotics Theme for titaniumrobotics.com.  You are allowed to download and use this theme on your own blog, but it was designed specifically for the titaniumrobotics.com web structure and is therefore, personalized with specific urls and icons.

#About

In this version of Team 1160's theme, Beryllium, everything from typography to user-interface to load time has been considered and designed to work in better harmony. The design is more robust, the typography is beautiful, and every aspect of the page has been meticulously thought over and designed to be beautiful, modern, and easy to use.

##Typography
Typography has been enhanced both aesthetics-wise and performance-wise through the use of standard ratios and Google Fonts. "Source Sans Pro" has been selected for the font because it is the standard font used in all of Titanium Robotics's marketing materials.

##UI
The User-Interface has been enhanced so that it follows basic rules of front-end web design. We reduced the number of clicks required to reach a destination, and we've enhanced the visibility of objects and the contrast on some of the more hard to see elements. The mobile version utilizes "responsivenav.js" in order to enhance the menu in a mobile environment. The anchors in mobile apps have been increased in size in order to prevent unintentional tappage.

##Performance & Speed
Performance and speed have drastically increased in this version. 

#Customization and features and stuff
##Logo
The logo used in this theme is 100px in height. You may replace the logo with your own logo, but remember to replace the link too.

##Colors
The main color is:#0067C6, it's the bright blue that is basically everywhere. If you want to replace it, just do a find all and replace with whatever color you would like to use.

###SVG Files
SVG files probably have #0067C6 or something that Adobe Illustrator converted a Pantone color to as one of the colors. You might want to change those too.

##Page Under Construction
To set a page as "Under Construction," go to the "Custom Fields" section of the Wordpress page and add a new "construction" field with the value "Under Construction." To disable, just delete the field.

##WIP
This doc is currently a work in progress. It may or may not be completed, but it's quite easy to customize this theme to your liking as long as you're thorough.
