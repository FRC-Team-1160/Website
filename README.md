#TEAM1160 v3.1

##Theme by Titanium Robotics and Nathan Wong

This is the third version of the Titanium Robotics Theme for titaniumrobotics.com.  You are allowed to download and use this theme on your own blog, but it was designed specifically for the titaniumrobotics.com web structure and is therefore, personalized with specific urls and icons.

#Usage
##Logo
The logo used in this theme is 94px in height. You may replace the logo with your own logo, but remember to replace the link too.

##Colors
The main color is:#0067C6, it's the bright blue that is basically everywhere. If you want to replace it, just do a find all and replace with whatever color you would like to use.

###SVG Files
SVG files probably have #0067C6 or something that Adobe Illustrator converted a Pantone color to as one of the colors. You might want to change those too.

##WIP
This doc is currently a work in progress. It may or may not be completed, but it's quite easy to customize this theme to your liking as long as you're thorough.
