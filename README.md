#Team1160 v5.0 beta "BORON"

##Theme by Titanium Robotics and Nathan Wong

This is the fifth version of the Titanium Robotics Theme for titaniumrobotics.com.  You are allowed to download and use this theme on your own blog, but it was designed specifically for the titaniumrobotics.com web structure and is therefore, personalized with specific urls and icons.

#About

In this version of Team 1160's theme, Boron, everything from typography to user-interface to load time has been considered and designed to work in better harmony. The design is more robust, the pagespeed enhanced, and the connection to the brand identity of Titanium Robotics has been made more elegant.

##UI
More responsive design, cleaner and better use of web elements. Created a better and more balanced feel to the design of the website.

##Performance & Speed
Performance and speed have drastically increased in this version. On a good day with a good server, this theme with basic server-end enhancements (Content Delivery Network, Caching, Minifcations, etc.) will get 90%+ on Google's Pagespeed.

##Behind the hood
The CSS has been cleaned up through combing and a lot of useless/unnecessary things were removed. Much of the files were combined, some were separated into different files to make it easier to follow. Use file combining to make it easier for the files to be delivered. Possible SCSS switch for the website in the future.

Working on removing useless trailing spaces and cleaning PHP code. Also working on optimizing the CSS code to be easier to follow and have comments so that people know whats up and how to use the code and what everything does. This may take a while, though because tbh I don't know what the code does all the time.

#Customization and features and stuff for other teams to use this as a boilerplate if they want to.....
This theme would be great if it were a more general use theme. However, it's more stylistically branded towards Titanium Robotics. This doesn't mean that you can't use it, though! Below are some of the comments on how our theme is customized towards our own brand. Of course, it doesn't include everything, but we're still working on making it have everything.

##Logo
The logo used in this theme is 100px in height. You may replace the logo with your own logo, but remember to replace the link too.

##Colors
The main color is:#0067C6, it's the bright blue that is basically everywhere. If you want to replace it, just do a find all and replace with whatever color you would like to use. Some of the colors use RGBA() or RGB(), do a search for "RGB" and you should be able to find it all.

There are classes for certain links like Twitter and Facebook and such that use the specific colors for those brands. There's also secondary color palette that is outlined by the Titanium Robotics Brand book and we use classes to make it easier for us to standardize our color usage accross the web.

###SVG Files
SVG files probably have #0067C6 or something that Adobe Illustrator converted a Pantone color to as one of the colors. You might want to change those too. (for example the down arrow svg file for the menu, you may want to replace that on your own, though because it is serving from our own static server)

##Page Under Construction
To set a page as "Under Construction," go to the "Custom Fields" section of the Wordpress page and add a new "construction" field with the value "Under Construction." To disable, just delete the field.

#WIP
This doc is currently a work in progress. It may or may not be completed, but it's quite easy to customize this theme to your liking as long as you're thorough.

####v4.1

* Bug crushing
* better responsiveness
* basically all the same things....
* basically stable.... or something.....

###v4.0 "Beryllium"

* Typography
** Typography has been enhanced both aesthetics-wise and performance-wise through the use of standard ratios and Google Fonts. "Source Sans Pro" has been selected for the font because it is the standard font used in all of Titanium Robotics's marketing materials.

* UI
** The User-Interface has been enhanced so that it follows basic rules of front-end web design. We reduced the number of clicks required to reach a destination, and we've enhanced the visibility of objects and the contrast on some of the more hard to see elements. The mobile version utilizes "responsivenav.js" in order to enhance the menu in a mobile environment. The anchors in mobile apps have been increased in size in order to prevent unintentional tappage.

* Performance & Speed
** Performance and speed have drastically increased in this version. 

* got rid of the splash page because it was coded extremely wrong and bad and it just looked a little weird.
* less blue header, but better and more stable coding/design
* WAY BETTER SPEED

####v3.1

* Brand spanking new bug fixes (probably brand spanking new bugs too)
* even better integration with Titanium Robotics branding
* Google Pagespeed scores of up to 90/100 (most of it is dependent on a good, fast server)
* FAST
* Better, more responsive Typography based on proven values for size.
* Use of 'Source Sans Pro'
* Some things that were added to make weird changes in CSS look perfectly intentional
